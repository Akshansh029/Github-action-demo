# GitHub Actions Demo

This repository is a personal sandbox for learning and practicing GitHub Actions — GitHub’s powerful CI/CD and automation tool.
Here, I explore how to automate workflows, run tests, deploy applications, and more.

## What I’m Learning

- Setting up basic workflows using .github/workflows
- Running jobs on push/pull requests
- Using environment variables and secrets
- Creating custom workflows for build/test/deploy
- Exploring matrix builds and conditional logic
- Using marketplace actions
